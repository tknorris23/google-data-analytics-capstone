Hello!

Welcome to my revised capstone project for the Google Advanced Data Analytics certificate course. This project builds on the original capstone featuring expanded analysis, hypothesis testing, and model creation. The aim of this project is to demonstrate my learning journey by thoroughly exploring employee retention prediction. By the end, we'll have two strong classifier models that can predict whether an employee will leave or stay with our company. Only the dataset and the Business Scenario below was taken from the original project, the rest of the code and text was created from scratch. Throughout the notebook I'll be giving commentary to guide you through my thought process while completing EDA, hypothesis testing, and machine learning model training.

Thank you for taking a look at my capstone project!

No AI tools were used to write the text in this notebook.
